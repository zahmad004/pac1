            <h4 style="text-transform:capitalize;">What is personnel reform vetting?</h4>

            <p>“Personnel vetting” is a broad term used to describe the 
            myriad of ways the Government evaluates its Federal and 
            contractor workforces for trustworthiness. The PAC PMO 
            focuses on three categories of vetting:</p>
            <ol class="ul-clean" style="padding-top:0px;">
              <li>
            <strong>Security Clearance </strong><br>
            The process used to determine 
            trustworthiness to access classified information.

            </li>
            <li><strong>Suitability & Fitness</strong><br>
             The process used to determine 
            whether personnel are adequately trustworthy to 
            perform the type of work required for a position. 
            </li>
            <li><strong>Credentialing</strong><br>
             The process used to determine whether 
            personnel are adequately trustworthy to be issued a 
            badge, typically granting physical access to a facility.
            </li>
            </ol>
         
        </div>
        <div class="usa-width-one-half" style="padding-left:20px;">
            <h4  style="text-transform:capitalize;">Why is personnel reform important?</h4>
            <p>The world continues to change at a quickening pace, requiring the SSC community to anticipate, detect, and counter both 
internal and external threats. SSC methods have struggled to 
keep pace with constantly evolving threats and new 
technological capabilities allow insiders to cause exponentially 
more harm than what was possible 60 years ago. </p>

<p>While there have been considerable reform achievements, there has been 
intense scrutiny from Congress and an erosion of the public’s 
confidence in the Federal Government’s ability to properly vet 
its workforce due to cybersecurity breaches and significant 
investigation backlogs. </p>
