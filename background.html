      <p> Established by <a href="https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2017-01-23/pdf/2017-01623.pdf" target="link">Executive Order 13467</a>, the Security, Suitability, and Credentialing Performance Accountability Council (more commonly known as the PAC) is accountable to the President for driving the implementation of personnel vetting reform initiatives, advising the Executive Agents on vetting policy, monitoring the performance of vetting practices, and identifying enterprise-level process enhancements among other responsibilities.</p>

        <h4 style="text-transform:capitalize;">What is personnel reform vetting?</h4>
        <p>“Personnel vetting” is a broad term used to describe the 
          myriad of ways the Government evaluates its Federal and 
          contractor workforces for trustworthiness. The PAC PMO 
          focuses on three categories of vetting:</p>
        <ol class="ul-clean" style="padding-top:0px;">
          <li> <strong>Security Clearance </strong><br>
            The process used to determine 
            trustworthiness to access classified information. </li>
          <li><strong>Suitability & Fitness</strong><br>
            The process used to determine 
            whether personnel are adequately trustworthy to 
            perform the type of work required for a position. </li>
          <li><strong>Credentialing</strong><br>
            The process used to determine whether 
            personnel are adequately trustworthy to be issued a 
            badge, typically granting physical access to a facility. </li>
        </ol>
      </div>
      <div class="usa-width-one-half" style="padding-left:20px;">
        <h4  style="text-transform:capitalize;">Why is personnel reform important?</h4>
        <p>The world continues to change at a quickening pace, requiring the SSC community to anticipate, detect, and counter both 
          internal and external threats. SSC methods have struggled to 
          keep pace with constantly evolving threats and new 
          technological capabilities allow insiders to cause exponentially 
          more harm than what was possible 60 years ago. </p>
        <p>While there have been considerable reform achievements, there has been 
          intense scrutiny from Congress and an erosion of the public’s 
          confidence in the Federal Government’s ability to properly vet 
          its workforce due to cybersecurity breaches and significant 
          investigation backlogs. </p>
