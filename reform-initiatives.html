          <h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
          <p>The government has broken down the reforms its pursing into reform initiatives with milestones. You will find a detailed list of reform initiatives and the status of each in the Reform Initiative Milestones section.  The Recent Key Highlights section features developments from the last few months that are progressing government reforms.  The Historical Reports section provides information on vetting reform from previous quarters.</p>

            <h3>Key Highlights</h3>
            <div class="">
              <ol class="ul-clean ul-highlights">
        <li><strong>Interagency began a series of workshops for prioritizing NBIB investigative backlog reductions recommendations</strong>.  <br>In August, representatives from DoD, ODNI, OPM, NBIB, and the PAC PMO began meeting to review a number of proposed changes to reduce NBIB&rsquo;s investigation backlog. These workshops, which are expected to conclude in October, will lead to a number of the recommendations being approved by the Executive Agents for implementation.</li>

        <li><strong>ODNI Continuous Evaluation System cleared a review hurdle.</strong>  <br>Continuous Evaluation (CE) is an automated capability to determine whether already cleared personnel have adverse information reported against them through repeated database checks. The ODNI&rsquo;s CE system passed an Operational Readiness Review in August, which allows the agency to offer the capability the broader personnel vetting community.</li>
        <li><strong>Shared Services for performing adjudications becomes available to NBIB customer agencies.</strong> <br>In September, NBIB deployed an automated adjudication determination capability for cases where no adverse information was identified during a Tier 1 and Tier 3 investigation. This advancement will permit NBIB customers, which make up about 95% of Executive Branch agencies, to avoid the time and cost associated with a human adjudicating these cases. The Government hopes to expand this capability in the future.</li>
